# Python Exercise # - ...

All required files are already included in this repository.
Your submissions will automatically be graded when pushed.

You may run the tests relevant for grading locally via

```
python -m pytest [--help]
```

This exercise is to be prepared in teams of two students.
Properly document the files you hand
in to receive full credit. Each module (file), class and function needs a
docstring. The purpose of each function needs to be summarized as a single
sentence and then, if required, your intent and the behavior of the function
can be described in more detail.

Furthermore, provide doctests for all functions (except `main()`) and classes.
Each of the
modules needs to include a `main()` function which calls the other functions
and prints appropriate output to `stdout`.
`main()` itself must be called by the ifmain pattern at the end of the file.
